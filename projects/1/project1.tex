\maketitle
{\bf Description:} You will be assigned to a group to adequately mix up interactions and experiences. You will present one of the named algorithms below.
You will provide a beamer presentation deck as an artifact for your group. Successful presentations will start with the nice summaries written in spinning up,
but expand along axes of inquiry like: in the original paper what were the key points and takeaways and what was novel.
You should include some demonstrations/explorations of these algorithms running for gym environments
(key feature of spinning up is you have access to these algorithms and you can play with them).

{\bf Guidance:} I will interact with the groups during the preparation of the presentation to insure that the beamer artifact covers all it needs to. I will also
help outline and troubleshoot them as necessary.

{\bf Timing:} Presentations will be 12 Feb 2020 and 14 Feb 2020 (during discussion section). They should last about 20 minutes.

{\bf Version Control:} Please make public fork of this repo and develop your materials in the appropriate directory.
